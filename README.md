1) Frameworks provide skeletel structure for a system with a mode of approach. Programming or developing a system from scratch would require lot of effort  as the developer needs to describe the whole system along with coding the complete system. Description of the whole system is required if someone has to use the code or enhance the system, and this would be more of organizing the stuff. Understanding a new framework would consume time for other people who are going to work on the system. So using an existing framework which suites your business or project would reduce the extra work or creating one. This way any programer who develops it or enhances it can reduce the time spent on designing or understanding a new one.

2) Most of the web related applications need to be done in a faster phase to sustain market competition. So the applications which depend on the time they are in the market require to use a well established and known framework that suites their business. This would facilitate a better approach to the new people working on the project.

3) Framework wouldnt be appropriate in case of small business or a personal website.

4) I learnt how to use sailsjs inorder to deploy a web application. I learnt how to use bootstrap css and general css to create buttons out of links and style tables and use navigation bars to complete effect. I learnt how to javascript in MVC applications to properly differentiate between control logic and view logic.

5) Openshift gives unpredictable errors with very less details on error. I worked on openshift for almost 15 hours to host my web application and i am unsuccessful.
